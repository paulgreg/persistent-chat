This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuration

Copy `src/config.json.dist` into `src/config.json` and update values according your needs.

## To dev

run `npm run dev:client` to launch client code (with watch) and `npm run dev:server` to launch server code

## To deploy on production using only node

Run `./build.sh` to generate static files into `build` directory.
Run `npm run start` which will serve static files.

## To deploy on production using nginx to serve static file (recommanded)

Run `./build.sh` to generate static files into `build` directory.

Serve static files via a web server like nginx.
Iâ€™m using a symbolic link from `/var/www/semi-persistent-chat` to the `build` directory.

Launch src/server code (I suggest you to use pm2 to launch server via `./pm2.sh`).

And adapt nginx to let pass web socket to node :

```
location /persistent-chat-ws/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6060;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}
```
